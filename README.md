For my Cyber Security Analytics with Python course we were asked to use docker to create a website that connected to MongoDB and PSQL.

Docker does not connect well with Windows 10 home, so I created a google cloud instance and SSH'd to it in order to do all the interfacing.

Similar to my Deploying_Model repository some of the code was given by our professor, but per the assignment I did all the set up and command line interfacing in order to get a website up and running.
